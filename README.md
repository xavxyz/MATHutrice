# MATHutrice

An LLM-based tutor that helps EPF first-year students practise mathematical
tools. A student signs in, picks a **notion** (trigonometry, logarithms,
polynomials…), and works through **competences** with generated exercises —
multiple choice, open answer, and step by step. Answers are corrected by the
**LLM endpoint**, scores are stored per competence, and the tutor recommends
the notions a student is weakest on. A free chat is available alongside the
exercises. Teachers and admins get their own pages, including PDF upload.

The vocabulary this project uses — *notion*, *competence*, **connexion de
développement**, **LLM endpoint** — is defined in [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md).
Decisions that shaped the code are in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## Run it locally

Requires **Python 3.14** (the exact version is in `.python-version`) and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which installs that Python and the locked
dependency versions from `uv.lock`.

```sh
uv sync
. .venv/bin/activate
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set `LLM_API_KEY` in `.env` to the key for your LLM endpoint. Everything
else in `.env.example` has a working default for a local run. Start the
application from the repository root:

```sh
uvicorn mathutrice.app:app --port 8000
```

It listens on <http://localhost:8000/>.

On the first start the tables are created and the reference data is inserted:
the notions and competences of `referentiel.py`, and one demonstration account
per role:

| Email | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `eleve@epf.fr` | Student |
| `enseignant@epf.fr` | Teacher |
| `admin@epf.fr` | Admin |

Only rows that are missing get inserted, so nothing is written when the data is
already there and restarting is safe. Only `@epf.fr` and `@epfedu.fr` addresses
may sign in.

To check that a fresh clone actually works, follow
[`docs/smoke-test.md`](docs/smoke-test.md).

## Configuration

Every variable the application reads is listed, with comments, in
`.env.example`. In short:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy URL. SQLite by default; PostgreSQL where it is deployed. |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | The OpenAI-compatible **LLM endpoint** every LLM call goes through. **Required.** |
| `LLM_MODEL` | The model served by that endpoint. **Required.** |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | The key for that endpoint. **Required.** |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Signing key for the session cookie. **Required.** |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `entra` (the default, Microsoft Entra ID) or `dev`. |
| `DEV_LOGIN_KEY` | Optional shared key protecting the `/dev/login` page. Ignored when `AUTH_MODE=entra`. |
| `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `TENANT_ID` | The Entra application. Needed when `AUTH_MODE=entra`. |
| `REDIRECT_URL` | Where Entra sends the user back after sign-in — this host's `/auth`. |
| `POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` | Where Entra sends the user after sign-out — this host's `/test_login`. |

The LLM defaults in `.env.example` use the Mistral API: get a key at
<https://console.mistral.ai> (a free account works). Any other OpenAI-compatible
endpoint works by changing the three `LLM_*` variables.

No key belongs in the repository. `.env` is not committed; `.env.example` holds
names and placeholders only.

## Connexion de développement (`AUTH_MODE=dev`)

With `AUTH_MODE=dev`, the application serves `/dev/login`, where you pick an
email address and a role and are signed in as that user **with no proof of
identity**. It is what lets you run MATHutrice without Entra credentials. A red
banner shows on every application page while it is on.

**It must never reach production.** In the deployment checklist:

- `AUTH_MODE` unset or `entra`
- `SESSION_SECRET` set to a random value, not the placeholder
- `DATABASE_URL` pointing at the deployed database
- `LLM_API_KEY` supplied by the environment, never committed
- `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `TENANT_ID`, `REDIRECT_URL` and
  `POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` set for the real host

`DEV_LOGIN_KEY` narrows who can reach the `/dev/login` page: when it is set, the
page asks for it and refuses the sign-in without it.

**`SESSION_SECRET` is the real gate, not `DEV_LOGIN_KEY`.** The session cookie
is signed with `SESSION_SECRET`; anyone who knows its value can forge a cookie
for any user and any role, and never sees the sign-in page at all. Leaving the
placeholder from `.env.example` in place on a reachable host makes
`DEV_LOGIN_KEY` decorative.

Signing in from a script means keeping the session cookie between requests:

```sh
curl -s -c cookies.txt -X POST \
  -d 'email=eleve@epf.fr&role=student' \
  http://localhost:8000/dev/login

curl -s -b cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/
```

The first call answers `303` with a `Set-Cookie: session=…`. `role` is
`student`, `teacher` or `admin`; `name` is optional and defaults to the existing
user's name, or one derived from the address. Add `-d 'key=…'` when
`DEV_LOGIN_KEY` is set.

Package boundaries are machine-checked: a name starting with `_` cannot be
imported from outside its package, and packages may not form an import cycle.
Read [`mathutrice/README.md`](mathutrice/README.md) before adding a package or
importing across one, and run the checks with:

```sh
tach check
python scripts/check_cycles.py
